# Design Patterns

## Definition
General, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.

This projects provide Java code examples of the **23 Gang of Four (GoF)** design patterns,
as listed in the book Design Patterns: _"Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"_.

## Types

- *Creational Patterns:* isolate object instantiation from the object implementation.
- *Structural Patterns:* isolate object combination to form large object structures .
- *Behavioral Patterns:* manage algorithms,relationships, and responsibilities between objects.

## Scopes
- *Object Scope:* pattern that abstracts object relationships (usually use delegation) that can be changed at runtime.
- *Class Scope:* pattern that abstracts class relationships (usually use inheritance) that can be changed at compile time.


## Summary

## Creation Patterns

|Pattern |Scope |Description                                                                 |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Abstract Factory** | Object |Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes|
|**Builder**          | Object |Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations|
|**Factory method**   | Object |Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses |
|**Prototype**        | Object |Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects from the 'skeleton' of an existing object, thus boosting performance and keeping memory footprints to a minimum |
|**Singleton**        | Object |Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it |
